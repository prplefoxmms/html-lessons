      <p>I am the founder of Ladlin Designs, a multi genre jewellery design business. I always had a keen interest in minerals and Gemstones when I was younger which later became the drive for me becoming a jeweller. </p>
      <p>The idea came to me back when I was in College, I remember talking to a group of friends of mine at the time about jewellery design. What they said changed the view of how I saw jewellery afterwards. They said that they found a lack of diversity in jewellery style and taste. That in order for them to get what they wanted, it would have to be commissioned and that was an expensive option</p>
      <p>That gave me a brilliant and profitable idea. </p>
